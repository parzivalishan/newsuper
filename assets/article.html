                <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">In a world saturated with constant noise and endless distractions, minimalism emerges as a powerful philosophy of intentional living. It's not just about having lessâ€”it's about making room for what truly matters.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-white">Simplifying Your Digital Landscape</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-300">Modern technology offers incredible connectivity, but it also bombards us with information. Minimalism in the digital realm means curating your online experiences, unsubscribing from unnecessary newsletters, and being intentional about your screen time.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-white">Physical Space, Mental Clarity</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-300">Your environment reflects your mental state. By reducing physical clutter, you create space for creativity, focus, and genuine experiences. Each item you own should serve a purpose or spark genuine joy.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-600 pl-4 italic my-6 text-gray-400">
                    "Minimalism is not about removing something, it's about making room for what matters most."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p class="text-gray-300">Embracing minimalism is a journey, not a destination. It's about continuous reflection, intentional choices, and understanding that less truly can be more.</p>
